# Maerl Whole Genome Sequencing Pipelines And Analysis

> Note: this repo will be continually updated as the project advances. 

The main purpose of this repository is to provide all of the code used to analyse whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from samples of maerl-forming species collected throughout England and the north-east Atlantic. The Nextflow pipelines have been developed based on the Illumina and Nanopore FASTQ files provided by the Sequencing Facility. This means that, although these pipelines could be adapted for other projects, they have been designed to process the file formatting used by the Sequencing Facility, and optimised to analyse WGS data for maerl-forming species in this study.
